# Release Notes - v1.0.0

**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: Stable Release
**System**: Stranger Things E-commerce Platform

## 📦 What's New

### 🚀 Complete Admin Dashboard
We have introduced a fully functional **Admin Panel** (`/admin`) to manage your store effortlessly:
- **Authentication**: Secure login system (Default: `admin` / `admin123`).
- **Dashboard**: Real-time overview of sales, orders, and active users.
- **Product Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products.
- **Collection Management**:
  - Create and edit dynamic collections (e.g., "Novidades", "Mais Vendidos").
  - **Drag-and-Drop Ordering**: Easily reorder collections to change how they appear on the Home Page.
  - Assign specific products to multiple collections.
- **Notifications**: System-wide toast notifications for success/error feedback.

### 🛍️ Collection & Catalog Features
- **Dynamic Collections**: The Home Page now reflects the collections configured in the Admin Panel.
- **Product-Collection Association**: Flexible many-to-many relationship allowing products to exist in multiple collections simultaneously.
- **Automated Import**: The system can now automatically import products from backup JSON files (`netflix-shop-products.json`, `gocase-products.json`) if the database is empty.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter products by collection in the Admin view.

### 💳 Checkout & User Experience
- **Checkout Spinner**: Fixed an issue where the loading spinner was not visible during checkout processing. Now provides clear visual feedback to the user.
- **Navigation**: Improved routing and page transitions.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjustments to layout for better mobile compatibility.

### ⚙️ Backend & Infrastructure
- **Hybrid Database Support**:
  - **SQLite**: Optimized for local development (`ecommerce.db`).
  - **PostgreSQL**: Native support for Vercel deployment via `POSTGRES_URL`.
- **Migrations System**: `migrations.sql` and auto-run checks to ensure the database schema is always up to date.
- **API Improvements**:
  - `/api/collections`: Endpoints for fetching and recording collections.
  - `/api/products`: Enhanced filtering and search capabilities.
  - `/api/auth`: JWT-based authentication for administrative actions.

## 🔧 Technical Details
- **Architecture**: Node.js + Express (Server), Vanilla JS (Frontend).
- **Persistence**: SQLite (Local) / PostgreSQL (Production).
